        <h2 class="header">A list of what I'm currently playing on whatever machine I've got.</h2>
        <div class="block">
            <h3>Minecraft</h3>
            <p>Because how could I not? Definitely a timeless classic, at least as of 2010 or so. Been playing since 1.8, and I guess you could say I've returned to those roots, playing mostly PvP on Hypixel with a <i>very small</i> collection of <i>only</i> 40-something Forge mods. Every now and then I open private SMPs for me and my friends. (Not anymore really)</p>

        <div class="block">
            <h3>Terraria</h3>
            <p>Started playing this a year after Journey's End after friends introduced me to it. Turns out, it's surprisingly addictive. Working on a solo Master Mode world and a Master (not Legendary) getfixedboi world with friends.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <h3>The Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom</h3>
            <p>The only game I have ever pre-ordered, and the only game I have ever been really, truly hyped about. I played Breath of the Wild back in 2018-19 on my Wii U, so I finished it up around the same time that TOTK was announced. The wait felt long, but very worth it.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <h3>Garry's Mod</h3>
            <p>Another staple of PC gaming, but not one I played during its peak. Only started recently, but it did get me into the rest of Valve's Source games.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <h3>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</h3>
            <p>Solid mid-tier skill level. I main Daisy and Ganondorf. Yes, Ganondorf. Daisy because it's awesome to just kill people as a princess, and Ganondorf because I picked him up when I played with friends before getting the game and learning actual tier lists, and just kept using him because he's low tier. I have an aspiration to hold an Ultimate tournament at my school or something one day.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <h3>Team Fortress 2</h3>
            <p>Discovered shortly after I started playing Garry's Mod. Installed it for the sole purpose of GMod asset mounting. My friends kept yelling at me to actually play it, and I finally did after about a year of having it in my Steam library. Pretty good, and probably the only online competitive shooter game I'll ever get around to playing.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="block">
            <h3>Stardew Valley</h3>
            <p>If you've never heard of this, I think it's best described as if Animal Crossing and Minecraft had a baby. Pretty awesome and calm game.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="block"> <!-- This stays on the bottom! -->
