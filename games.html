        <h1>Games I'm Playing</h1>
        <h2 class="header">A list of what I'm currently playing on whatever machine I've got.</h2>
        <div class="game">
            <h3>Minecraft</h3>
            <p>Because how could I not? Definitely a timeless classic, at least as of 2010 or so. Been playing since 1.8, and I guess you could say I've returned to those roots, playing mostly PvP on Hypixel with a <i>very small</i> collection of <i>only</i> 40-something Forge mods. Every now and then I open private SMPs for me and my friends</p>

        </div>
        <div class="game">
            <h3>Terraria</h3>
            <p>Started playing this a year after Journey's End after friends introduced me to it. Turns out, it's surprisingly addictive.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="game">
            <h3>Garry's Mod</h3>
            <p>Another staple of PC gaming, but not one I played during its peak. Only started recently, but it did get me into the rest of Valve's Source games.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="game">
            <h3>Forza Horizon series</h3>
            <p>To be fair, I only play this one whenever I have Xbox Game Pass. Still, great game, would recomend for racing fans.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="game">
            <h3>Animal Crossing: New Horizons</h3>
            <p>The amount I've played this game has dramatically fallen since I got it in 2020, but it's not a bad game if you have an attention span.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="game">
            <h3>The Legend of Zelda: Breath of the Wild (and planning to play the sequel)</h3>
            <p>Back in 2018-19, I completely obsessed over this one. Played it on Wii U non-stop until I got bored of grinding post-Ganon. Everything except Korok seeds I 100%-d. (I never got the DLC) Just waiting for the sequel now.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="game">
            <h3>Super Smash Bros. Ultimate</h3>
            <p>Solid mid-tier skill level. I main Daisy and Ganondorf. Yes, Ganondorf. Daisy because it's awesome to just kill people as a princess, and Ganondorf because I picked him up when I played with friends before getting the game and learning actual tier lists, and just kept using him because he's low tier. I have an aspiration to hold an Ultimate tournament at my school or something one day.</p>
